#QUESTION : 
 /* Write the SQL query to get the third maximum movie runtime from the movies table.*/

#While there are several ways of achieving same objective in #SQL #Query, in solving the above task, I employed #OFFSET #Keyword.
OFFSET is used to determine which rows of dataset to return based on their position in the query and not their by their values. 
Hence, It determines the number of rows to skip from the beginning of the returned data before presenting the results.
When combined with LIMIT below, the offset function is retrieved before the limit. 
So OFFSET 2, skip first 2 rows to land on the 3rd row. Then LIMIT 1 picks the 3rd row. 

You can achieve same output with subqueries, I just thought to put the OFFSET Function out there. 

SELECT 
  *
FROM movies
ORDER BY runtime DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;

I used PostgreSQL for this challenge.

How would you have solved this?
